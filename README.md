# Towers_of_Hanoi
this is the second project of Graphical User Interface Prog.

The Towers of Hanoi game is a very old game where you have a board with three pegs on it. A set of differently sized disks is placed on the first peg with the disks being in order with the smallest on the top. The game is to transfer the disks from the first peg to the third by moving only one disk at a time, only taking disks from the top of any pile and never putting a larger disk on top of a smaller disk. The player tries to do this in as few moves as possible.
